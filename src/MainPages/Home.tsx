            I developed my skills after graduating with my undergrad degree in animation at the Norwich University of the Arts in 2016. As a freelancer and motion graphic designer, I gained experience in the graphic design industry. I noticed I had a passion for graphic design, which led me to complete a master's in communication design. My practice is motion graphics due to my degree in animation; I always want to see what my designs look like when they apply movement. Thanks to that experience, I can make my work look energetic and approachable.

            I always try to keep an open mind and take people's opinions and suggestions on board when developing my designs. I believe this makes me a better designer while pushing myself to achieve that next level of work. It also allows me to interact with those people viewing my creative work.

            My strength has always been to come up with new ideas on the spot and figure out how to implement them into my designs. This leads me to play with different ideas, which I enjoy even in my spare time. I also try to inject humour and personality into my work to help people connect to my designs. This year in my master's, I've discovered why I love graphic design, which has given me a new drive to succeed and reach my potential.
